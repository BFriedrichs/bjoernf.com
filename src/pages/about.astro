      This website is built using <Ref
        text="Astro"
        href="https://astro.build/"
      /> and supported by MongoDB. Everything is dockerised and I use this handy

      <Ref
        text="Let's Encrypt Companion"
        href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion"
      />
       to do the signing legwork for me.
    </span>
    <span>
      The best part: All the code is public at{" "}
      <Ref href="https://github.com/BFriedrichs/bjoernf.com" />

      To get minimal information about my site statistics, I use{" "}
      <Ref text="Ackee" href="https://ackee.electerious.com" />. I self host
      this analytics package to gives me insight into the generated traffic
      without storing any personal identifiable information.{" "}
      <Ref
        text="Go to their documentation"
        href="https://docs.ackee.electerious.com/#/docs/Anonymization"
      />
       to find out what Ackee collects. Please note that I do collect the
      detailed information as outlined on their page.
