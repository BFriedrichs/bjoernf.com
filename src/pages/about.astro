      This website is built using React and delivered using{" "}
      <Ref text="aiohttp" href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/" /> and
      supported by MongoDB. Everything is dockerised and I use this handy
      <Ref
        text="Let's Encrypt Companion"
        href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion"
      />
       to do the signing legwork for me.
    </span>
    <span>
      The best part: All the code is public at{" "}
      <Ref href="https://github.com/BFriedrichs/bjornf.dev" />

    </span>
    <span>
      To get information about the behavior of my visitors, I use{" "}
      <Ref text="Ackee" href="https://ackee.electerious.com" />. This analytics
      software gives me insight about my visitors only in general, but not about
      individuals per se, as it does not track visitors and does not store any
      personal identifiable information.{" "}
      <Ref
        text="Go to their documentation"
        href="https://docs.ackee.electerious.com/#/docs/Anonymization"
      />
       to find out what Ackee collects. Please note that I do collect the
      detailed information as outlined on their page.
